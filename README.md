 The Hearthstone of Chess



# Dreamer Chess

# (tentative name/theme idea)

# (Do GMs Dream of Electric Knights)

**Description**

Dreamer Chess combines classic chess gameplay with turn based strategy (SRPG) elements complete with a mana system, a variety of classes, spells and new pieces. Games would ideally last between 5-15 minutes, and instill the &quot;just one more game&quot; feeling after either winning or losing a match. The goal of Dreamer Chess is to offer a fun alternative to the at times &quot;solved/known&quot; strategies of chess. The hearthstone compared to MtG so to say.

Matches will function the exact same as a regular game of chess with the starting pieces, board, and piece movement all being the same. However, there are many added mechanics that will offer new tactics and routes to win.

-Focus on PvP

-Pixel Art Style (either top down or isometric?)

-Chip Tune Ost, or something more chill?

-Mana resource represented by a thermometer gauge.

(Reason I am going with &quot;dream&quot; chess for now is that the classes in the game could stem from a persona-esq awakening, where they are normal people irl but the game changes when they go to sleep (daydream). That&#39;s why the mechanics are so busted relative to normal chess.)

-There wouldn&#39;t be any narrative, this could just explain why some of the game mechanics are so wacky.

-Would be cool to have a very short animated sequence when a match starts showing the normal characters changing into their in game class.

-the normal characters would be a variety of ages?

-not sold on this idea but maybe it&#39;ll get somewhere.

**Ways to win**

1. Checkmate the enemy king
2. Get a predetermined randomly selected pawn to the opposite end of the board. The pawn is chosen at the beginning of the match before the mulligan phase.
3. Win on time, have more than zero seconds left on your clock when your opponents clock runs out.

# **Game Features**

**Classes...**

Each playable class has their own unique spells, upgradable pieces, and ability cards. Playstyles change drastically class to class with some excelling at the early game, and others needing to survive longer to unleash their strengths.

**Upgrades…**

Two main types of upgrades...

**Permanent,** these upgrades last the rest of the game or until the piece is removed or silenced.

**One Time,** the upgrade only does something once, these pieces can be upgraded multiple times if the effect has been removed or used up. (see Barbarian Bolster Queen upgrade)

**Spells....**

Spells are used to influence the board, buff (upgrade) pieces and generally shift the tempo of the game. The cost of spells is universal and unchanging, they cost the same for each class, 2/5/10/20/30.

Spells CANNOT directly target the enemy king, however, spells that target a random enemy have the chance to hit the king. Can only play one spell per turn.

**Ability Cards…**

Ability cards are one time use cards that the player will select before the game starts from a predetermined assortment of &quot;shared&quot; cards that are the same for every class, and class specific cards that only pertain to an individual class. The player will only be able to choose one card per game, and can choose to use it during the &quot;Tactics&quot; phase. (might be too op for certain classes)

(Add card variety, active cards and ones that are passive until some requirement is fulfilled and then they act like a &quot;trap card&quot;?)

(Should every class have one trap card to make things spicy?)

**Shared Card Pool**

1. Gain +3 spirit
2. Silence a friendly piece
3. Give a piece divine shield
4. Give a piece spirit shield

**Spirit...**

Spirit functions as the resource required to cast spells. Each player gains 1 spirit per turn, the player who goes second gains a single additional spirit at the beginning of the game.

Added flavor, spirit is akin to the confidence of the player, when you capture pieces or progress in the game, your confidence grows, as does your spirit.

Each piece is worth a corresponding value of Spirit

Pawn = 1

Knight, Bishop = 3

Rook = 6

Queen = 9

King = 1 (this can happen sometimes for certain classes) should it be more?

When capturing pieces the spirit is added to your total spirit, Upgraded pieces are worth double spirit.

When an opposing piece is captured, the player who captures said piece also receives the corresponding amount of spirit immediately.

**Friendly captures** , it is possible to capture your own pieces by hitting them with a friendly projectile, this will remove the piece from the board.

-Functions like deny in DOTA?

-Thematically it would make more sense to either net zero spirit, or lose spirit when capturing friendly pieces as the act of losing units should be more demoralizing than inspiring.

-For now players will not gain or lose spirit for friendly captures, unless otherwise specified in the upgrade/spell description.

(it could also add spirit? Would that make some characters too powerful)

**Phases of a Turn…**

There are 3 phases to a player&#39;s turn.

1. Tactics: Choose to spend spirit OR use your chosen ability card. (cannot do both)
2. Attack(position): Move one piece of your choice
3. Resolve: Any pieces that carry passive effects/attributes take place during this phase. The order of effects is always in the order that the pieces were upgraded.

If a king is put into check at any given part of the 3 phases, the turn ends automatically and the checked player&#39;s turn begins immediately.

**Mulligan Phase…**

At the beginning of each match, both players enter the Mulligan Phase, after a coinflip determines who goes first. During this phase you also select one &quot;ability card&quot; from an assortment of shared cards, and unique cards. Should these choices be randomized or kept the same for each match?

**Miscellaneous…**

-Captured pieces appear below the board, each player will have a designated section for captured pieces. If a piece was removed from the board in a different fashion, it will have its own designated area.

Ex: if a piece was &quot;Banished&quot; (See Necromancer for further details)

-Kings will not be checkmated if hit by a projectile, but rather stunned for one turn, while stunned, they cannot move and if put in check while stunned, they are checkmated.

-If the other player has more than one king, you can no longer check any of the kings. Once the extra kings have been removed you can once again put the enemy king into check.

&quot; **Dodgeball opening&quot;**

-Potential idea where there are two highlighted squares in the middle of the board that function the same as the balls at the beginning of a dodgeball match. Whoever gets to the squares first gets either spirit added to their total, or upgrades the piece that landed on the square.

-The highlighted squares would have to be of equal opportunity for both players, going first might be too much of an advantage with this mechanic?

-Having board objectives would be fun, but might be too difficult to balance on the small chess board. Maybe could think of expanding the board size?

**Shared Spell Mechanics**

**Divine Shield** **(change name eventually)****-** Absorb one hit from a projectile or enemy capture attempt. If used to block a capture attempt, the piece initiating the capture removes the shield from the defending piece and stops on the tile in front of the defending piece. If a knight attacks a piece with divine shield, they do not move even after attacking.

**Spirit Shield-** Negate a status effect one time, absorb one projectile, absorb one spell.

**Upgrade-** Upgrade a friendly piece of your choice into its class specific upgraded version.

**Silence-** Reverts a chosen piece back to its base form and removes ALL buffs/debuffs.

**Projectiles-** Pieces that come into contact with a projectile are instantly captured. Projectiles can take on different shapes/forms, but all function the same. Ex: a cannonball and a glaive projectile would serve the same purpose despite looking different.

**Lobbed projectiles** : Projectiles that are lobbed can safely be used when behind friendly pieces.

**Rooted-** A rooted piece can no longer move.

**Aura-** A glow surrounds the piece which does a variety of things to the 8 squares surrounding the piece.

Basic Outline, pitch

Dreamer Chess, aka &quot;Do GMs dream of electric knights&quot;

Dreamer Chess at its core is a modified version of chess that takes classic chess, and expands gameplay with some mechanics from SRPGs, and Collectible Card Games. It can be described as Chess meets Fire Emblem, meets Hearthstone. There are a variety of playable classes each with their own unique spells, upgradable pieces, and playstyles. In order to upgrade pieces, or cast spells, the player needs to manage a mana resource called &quot;spirit&quot; (more on spirit below). The goal of Dreamer Chess is to provide a fun PvP alternative to the at times solved nature of mid to high level chess, with an emphasis placed on hype situational play making, and dynamic explosive gameplay.

Routes to Victory...

-Checkmate the enemy king.

-Get a predetermined randomly selected pawn to the opposite end of the board. The pawn is chosen at the beginning of the match and functions as &quot;the golden snitch&quot; of dreamer chess.

-Win on time, have more than zero seconds left on your clock when your opponents clock runs out.

Classes...

Each playable class has their own unique trait, spells and upgradable pieces that center around the respective &quot;flavor&quot; of each distinctive class. Playstyles change drastically class to class with some excelling at the early game, and others needing to survive longer to unleash their true potential.

Spells....

Spells are used to influence the board, buff pieces, upgrade pieces and generally shift the tempo of the game. The cost of spells is universal and unchanging. They cost the same for each class, 2/5/10/20/30. Spells CANNOT directly target the enemy king, however, spells that target a random enemy have the chance to hit the king. Players can only play one spell per turn.

Spirit...

-Spirit functions as the resource required to cast spells. Each player gains 1 spirit per turn, the player who goes second gains a single additional spirit at the beginning of the game.

-Added flavor, spirit is akin to the confidence of the player, when you capture pieces or progress in the game, your confidence grows, as does your spirit.

-Each chess piece is worth a corresponding value of Spirit...

Pawn = 1

Knight, Bishop = 3

Rook = 6

Queen = 9

King = 1 (this can happen sometimes for certain classes)

-When an opposing piece is captured, the player who captures said piece also receives the corresponding amount of spirit immediately.

-Friendly captures, it is possible to capture your own pieces by hitting them with a friendly projectile (see below for more on projectiles), this will remove the piece from the board.

Phases of a Turn…

There are 3 phases to a player&#39;s turn.

1. Tactics: Choose if you would like to spend spirit.

2. Attack: Move one piece of your choice.

3. Resolve: Any pieces that carry passive effects/attributes take place during this phase. The order of effects respects the order in which pieces were upgraded/given an effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few explanations of some of the shared spell mechanics (mechanics that multiple classes have access to) in Dreamer Chess...

Spirit Shield: Negate a status effect one time, or absorb one hit from a projectile, or negate one spell. If any of these situations occurs the shield is broken.

Might Shield: Absorb one hit from a projectile or block an enemy capture attempt. If used to block a capture attempt, the piece initiating the capture removes the shield from the defending piece and stops on the tile closest to the opposing piece in respect to its approach.

Upgrade: Promote a friendly piece of your choice into its class specific upgraded version.

Silence: Reverts a chosen piece back to its base form and removes ALL buffs/debuffs.

Projectiles- Pieces that come into contact with a projectile are instantly captured. Projectiles can take on different shapes/forms, but all function the same. Ex: a cannonball and a glaive projectile would serve the same purpose despite looking different.

Rooted- A rooted piece can no longer move.

Aura- A glow surrounding a piece which can do a variety of things which influence the 8 squares surrounding the piece.
