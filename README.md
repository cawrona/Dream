# Dream
 The Hearthstone of Chess

**ReadMe by: Ellis Yuen-Rapati**

&quot;Do GM&#39;s dream of electric knights?&quot;

Dreamer Chess at its core is a modified version of chess that takes classic chess, and expands gameplay with some mechanics from SRPGs, and Collectible Card Games. It can be described as Chess meets Fire Emblem, meets Hearthstone. There are a variety of playable classes each with their own unique spells, upgradable pieces, and playstyles. In order to upgrade pieces, or cast spells, the player needs to manage a mana resource called &quot;spirit&quot; (more on spirit below). The goal of Dreamer Chess is to provide a fun PvP alternative to the at times solved nature of mid to high level chess, with an emphasis placed on hype situational play making, and dynamic explosive gameplay.

Routes to Victory...

-Checkmate the enemy king.

-Get a predetermined randomly selected pawn to the opposite end of the board. The pawn is chosen at the beginning of the match and functions as &quot;the golden snitch&quot; of dreamer chess.

-Win on time, have more than zero seconds left on your clock when your opponents clock runs out.

Classes...

Each playable class has their own unique trait, spells and upgradable pieces that center around the respective &quot;flavor&quot; of each distinctive class. Playstyles change drastically class to class with some excelling at the early game, and others needing to survive longer to unleash their true potential.

Spells....

Spells are used to influence the board, buff pieces, upgrade pieces and generally shift the tempo of the game. The cost of spells is universal and unchanging. They cost the same for each class, 2/5/10/20/30. Spells CANNOT directly target the enemy king, however, spells that target a random enemy have the chance to hit the king. Players can only play one spell per turn.

Spirit...

-Spirit functions as the resource required to cast spells. Each player gains 1 spirit per turn, the player who goes second gains a single additional spirit at the beginning of the game.

-Added flavor, spirit is akin to the confidence of the player, when you capture pieces or progress in the game, your confidence grows, as does your spirit.

-Each chess piece is worth a corresponding value of Spirit...

Pawn = 1

Knight, Bishop = 3

Rook = 6

Queen = 9

King = 1 (this can happen sometimes for certain classes)

-When an opposing piece is captured, the player who captures said piece also receives the corresponding amount of spirit immediately.

-Friendly captures, it is possible to capture your own pieces by hitting them with a friendly projectile (see below for more on projectiles), this will remove the piece from the board.

Phases of a Turn…

There are 3 phases to a player&#39;s turn.

1. Tactics: Choose if you would like to spend spirit.

2. Attack: Move one piece of your choice.

3. Resolve: Any pieces that carry passive effects/attributes take place during this phase. The order of effects respects the order in which pieces were upgraded/given an effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few explanations of some of the shared spell mechanics (mechanics that multiple classes have access to) in Dreamer Chess...

Spirit Shield: Negate a status effect one time, or absorb one hit from a projectile, or negate one spell. If any of these situations occurs the shield is broken.

Might Shield: Absorb one hit from a projectile or block an enemy capture attempt. If used to block a capture attempt, the piece initiating the capture removes the shield from the defending piece and stops on the tile closest to the opposing piece in respect to its approach.

Upgrade: Promote a friendly piece of your choice into its class specific upgraded version.

Silence: Reverts a chosen piece back to its base form and removes ALL buffs/debuffs.

Projectiles- Pieces that come into contact with a projectile are instantly captured. Projectiles can take on different shapes/forms, but all function the same. Ex: a cannonball and a glaive projectile would serve the same purpose despite looking different.

Rooted- A rooted piece can no longer move.

Aura- A glow surrounding a piece which can do a variety of things which influence the 8 squares surrounding the piece.
